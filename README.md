Project Guideline: Idea Proposal Submission 
This idea proposal should not exceed 1 page and each step should be described very birefly. 
This is an initial document for your future research. You will do a more comprehensive
research in the next step. 
1. Project Idea: 

 Start by selecting a project idea that interests you. It could be related to SDGs,
such as healthcare, poverty reduction etc. 
 Clearly define the problem you want to solve or the task you want to

achieving sustainability in areas like poverty reduction, environmental
conservation, health, education, etc. 

3. Literature Examples:

papers that are similar to your idea. These examples can serve as references and
sources of inspiration for your project. Please explain briefly. 

4. Describe Your Data: 

 Describe the data you plan to use for your project. Include details such as the
source of the data, data format (e.g., CSV, images, text), size, and any data
preprocessing steps required. 

5. Approach (Machine Learning or Deep Learning): 

 Choose whether you will use a machine learning or deep learning approach to
solve your problem. Justify your choice based on the complexity of the task and
the nature of the data.
