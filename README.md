1. Project Idea: 
•	My project idea is “Mental Health Detection from Social Media Posts.”
•	The goal is to analyze social media text (such as Facebook or X posts) to detect possible signs of mental health issues like stress, anxiety, or depression. Many people including Myanmar express their emotions online, and early detection through text analysis can help raise awareness and promote mental well-being.
•	The specific goal is to build a system that can classify a post as positive, neutral, or show signs of depression/stress that can be integrated into the social media platform and check the mental health.
2. Relevance to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 
•	This project supports SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all.
•	By identifying emotional distress in online content, the system can contribute to mental health awareness, help NGOs or health organizations identify at-risk individuals, and promote early intervention.
•	Indirectly, it also contributes to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by promoting innovative AI-driven approaches in healthcare. 
3. Literature Examples: 
•	Natural language processing applied to mental illness detection: a narrative review

4. Describe Your Data: 
•	Text data, csv file. 
•	We will train with English data first and after that we will put the translate algorithms for the different languages.

5. Approach (Machine Learning or Deep Learning): 
•	We will test with both machine learning and deep learning.
•	After that we will choose the better way and models.
•	Machine learning
o	SVM, XGBoost, ….
•	Deep learning
o	BERT-based transformer model or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
